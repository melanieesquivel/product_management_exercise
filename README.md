## Sprint Ceremonies

#### Sprint Planning:
The Sprint Planning phase happens at the beginning of each Sprint. It is led by the Scrum Master and is a collaborative meeting between the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Dev Team. 

*Structure:* 
This meeting will not exceed 4 hours as sprints 2 weeks long.
* Dev Team (Tech Lead, Frontend Dev, Backend Dev, Design Lead, UX Researcher, Content Strategist) will:
1. Organize the Backlog and add any new PBIs that are necessary.
2. Create a Sprint Goal (1-2 line goal)
3. Give values to user stories
4. Establish velocity and gauge capacity to complete the Sprint Goal.
* Product Owner will clarify any details needed.
* Scrum Master will act as facilitator throughout the meeting as well as schedule the meeting.

*Output:* 
Dev Team will commit to a Sprint Goal, have a list of user stories that will be addressed, and have a finalized backlog for future sprints.

#### Daily Scrum
Daily Scrums will occur at the same time each day in the morning. The Scrum Master and Dev Team have a required attendance, the Product Owner's presence is optional.

*Structure:* 
* Team will assemble and Dev Team members will discuss:
1. What the memeber worked on the previous day.
2. What the member plans on working on that day.
3. Discuss any blockers.
* The Scrum Master is responsible for removing blockers.
* This meeting will not exceed 15 minutes.

*Output:*
Team will have a better understanding of what all team members are doing that day and have an opportunity to discuss issues/collaborate.

#### Sprint Review:
This is the meeting where all items completed during the sprint are shown to the stakeholders. 

*Structure:* 
* Sprint Team (Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Dev Team) and Stakeholders attend. Outside stakeholders may attend if invited.
* Will last approximately 2 hours (1 hour per week of the sprint)
* Scrum Master Schedules the meeting and takes on administrative roles (i.e. booking the meeting and setting up).
* Team will convey in the presentation the user experience and business value of the sprint. 
* Product Owner asks questions to stakeholders and gathers feedback.

*Output:* 
Scrum Team is provided feedback on the sprint. This allows Sprint Team to gauge if they are on the correct path or not, see if they need to add or remove any user stories and confirm items are within scope.

#### Retrospective:
Meeting where team looks back on sprint and identifies ways to improve collaboration, teamwork, and efficiency.

*Structure:* 
* Scrum Master and Dev Team attend. Product Owner is optional. No one else should attend.
* Meeting will last approximately an hour and a half. 
* Team memebers will go over facts of how the sprint process flowed and how it may be improved.

*Output:* 
Dev Team has a plan to work more collaboratively together. Will have written actionable steps that are assigned and followed up on in the next Retrospective.
